### Subject : &nbsp;

*Hex is an elaborate, magic-powered and self-building computer (not unlike the ‘shamble’, a kind of
magical device used by the Witches of the Discworld) and is housed in the basement of the High Energy
Magic Building at the Unseen University (UU) in the twin city of Ankh-Morpork.
Hex is a computer unlike any other. Programmed via ‘Softlore’, Hex runs and evolves under the watchful
eyes of wizard Ponder Stibbons, who becomes the de facto IT manager at UU because he’s the only one
who understands what he’s talking about.
Hex has its origins in a device created by some student Wizards in the High Energy Magic building.
In this form it was simply a complex network of glass tubes, containing ants. The wizards could then
use punched cards to control which tubes the ants could crawl through, enabling it to perform simple
mathematical functions.

Let’s pay close attention to its calculation unit: an anthill with rooms and tunnels. A room can be connected to an infinite number of other rooms by as many tunnels as needed, but a tunnel can only connect two rooms.

It would be nice to build one of our own, but since we’re not really into DIY, let’s make a high-tech version:
a “Hex’ calculation unit” simulator.

On the standard input, your program must receive the anthill description the following way: first, the number of ants, then the rooms and their position and finally the tunnels (defined by the rooms they connect).

Read the subject for more details and examples.

Good luck.
